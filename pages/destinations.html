                    More than 7,000 feet above sea level in the Andes Mountains, 
                    <strong>Machu Picchu</strong> is the most visited tourist destination in Peru. 
                    A symbol of the Incan Empire and built around 1450AD, 
                    Machu Picchu was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 
                    1983 and was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World 
                    in 2007.

                    <strong>Rio de Janeiro</strong> is the second largest city in Brazil, on the South
                    Atlantic coast. Rio is famous for its breathtaking landscape, its 
                    laid-back beach culture and its annual carnival. The "Carioca Landscapes 
                    between the Mountain and the Sea" has been inscribed on the UNESCO World 
                    Heritage list. The harbour of Rio de Janeiro is comprised of a unique entry 
                    from the ocean that makes it appear as the mouth of a river. Additionally, 
                    the harbor is surrounded by spectacular geographic features including Sugarloaf 
                    mountain at 395 meters (1,296 feet), Corcovado Peak at 704 meters (2,310 feet), 
                    and the hills of Tijuca at 1,021 meters (3,350 feet). These features work together 
                    to collectively make the harbor one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.

                    <strong>Venice</strong> Italy is an Italian city located in the northeast of the State. Venice, 
                    Venezia in Italian, is best known for its beauty, canals, architecture, and art. 
                    But there is more! This small city founded in the middle of a lagoon has been one 
                    the most powerful European States for several centuries, giving birth to a culture 
                    and lifestyle that are incredibly unique. Often called the Serenissima, after the 
                    successful government which ruled the city, Venice has been for centuries the favourite 
                    city of artists and inventors. Many habits, words, and things currently part of our 
                    daily life were born in this small but immensely important city.

                    <strong>Zermatt</strong> lies at the foot of the Matterhorn. The town's touristic development is 
                    closely linked to what is most probably the world's most famous mountain. The vacation 
                    destination is a car-free zone, has preserved its original character and offers nearly 
                    unlimited possibilities as far as excursions are concerned. The location of Zermatt at 
                    the foot of the Matterhorn and in the middle of an enormous hiking and ski region makes 
                    it one of the world's most attractive vacation villages. The ski region encompasses 54 
                    mountain railways and lifts as well as 360 kilometers of pistes. The region called 
                    "Matterhorn glacier paradise" is Europe's largest and highest lying summer skiing region. 
                    Numerous national ski teams train here in the summer.

                    <strong>Johannesburg</strong> is South Africa’s most diverse, progressive and energetic city, the country’s 
                    best showcase for activism and optimism. There’s really nowhere better if you want to see 
                    the face of modern South Africa and get a sense of how far the nation’s come and where it’s 
                    going next. High-intensity in everything it does, Johannesburg manages not only to be the 
                    country’s biggest and the continent’s richest city but also – at least according to the locals 
                    – the world’s largest man-made forest. There are some ten million trees dotted around, lending 
                    the place a surprisingly fresh and spacious feel.

                    <strong>Bangkok</strong> is one of those cities that never gets old. No matter how many times you’ve been, 
                    you’ll always discover something new and exciting to see, do, and eat.
                    It’s got a near perfect mix of food, culture, nightlife, shopping, and affordability 
                    that’s unmatched anywhere in Southeast Asia. We’ve traveled to Bangkok so many
                    times over the years that it feels almost like a second home. Such is the allure of the 
                    world’s most visited city for the last four years and running. It doesn’t matter where you’re 
                    from or what you’re into. Bangkok will have something for you.
